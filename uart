serial communication:8 bit data is transfered one bit at a time.UART is a serial communication
there are two types of serial communication. they are:synchronous and asynchronous.
synchronous:data is synchronous with clock
asynchronous:no clock is transmitted.
parallel communication:8 bit data is transfered at a time.
baudrate:transmitter and receiver agree on clock speed of data transmission.
Duplex:data transmitted and received.
simple:data tranmitted only or received only.
hald duplex:data transmitted in only one way at a time.
full duplex:data transmitted in both ways at a time.ex:UART
stop bit-one or two bits
parity-odd or even.used for error checking.
types are:even(even number of 1s),odd(odd numberof 1s).
